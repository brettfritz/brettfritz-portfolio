# Brett Fritz Portfolio

## Purpose

I built this portfolio website in order to showcase my skills as a web developer, and to provide a place for professionals and employers to access and review my work.

## Description and Usage

This portfolio website displays a small about me section, letting visitors know a little bit about my personal and professional life. It describes who I am, what I do, and and what my purpose is. It also provides a recent picture of myself so visitors can see who they are reading about.

The portfolio website also contains all of my current web development projects, as well as future projects that I am either working on, or plan to develop in the future. Projects in my portfolio that are completed are linked to the URL of the live website so that visitors can see my work in action.

Lastly, the website contains all of my contact information and a link to my Github so visitors can see the source code for my contact, or reach out to me directly.
